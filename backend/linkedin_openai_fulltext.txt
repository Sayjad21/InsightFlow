At OpenAI, we believe artificial intelligence has the potential to help people solve immense global challenges, and we want the upside of AI to be widely shared. Join us in shaping the future of technology.
Post: Whenever I talk with people about AI, one of the first questions I get is almost always: what will this mean for my job? I believe AI will open up more opportunities than any technology in history but it will also change how work gets done. Today were announcing OpenAI-Certified and the OpenAI Jobs Platform two new initiatives that are about helping people become fluent in AI and connecting them with employers who need their skills. We cant eliminate the disruption AI will bring, but we can make sure the benefits are shared broadly, not just by a fortunate few. This is one big step in the right direction.

Post: One of the things Im most excited about with ChatGPT is how its revolutionizing healthcare. GPT-5 is our best model yet for answering health questions. It scores significantly higher than any previous model on HealthBench, an evaluation OpenAI published earlier this year based on realistic scenarios in partnership with over 250 physicians. Felipe, a member of our OpenAI team, and his wife Carolina shared their story on todays livestream, and it really moved me. Last October, Carolina was hit with three cancer diagnoses in one week. Like many, her biopsy results felt overwhelming and confusing. On a whim, she took a screenshot of the biopsy report and put it into ChatGPT. Within seconds, it translated the medical jargon into plain language, helping her feel more in control and more prepared to talk to her doctor about next steps. Shes kept using ChatGPT throughout her cancer journey, even to help make a tough choice about radiation when doctors gave conflicting advice. Its incredible to hear how ChatGPT restored her sense of agency during these critical decisions. You can watch the full livestream and their story here:

Post: As OpenAI's Chief Economist, I get lots of questions about how AI is changing jobs. To help answer them, Ive been speaking with people across occupations to learn how theyre thinking about AI and how its showing up in their day to day. I wanted to start with some professions that you are not reading about every day in the news if you are tracking the AI & jobs discussion in the press. Over the next few weeks, Ill be sharing highlights from these conversations paired with my takeaways on how AI is shaping the future of work. First up is my conversation with, better known as Principal Mo, an elementary and middle school principal who was a very early user of ChatGPT. A champion of AI in education, she has helped fellow administrators, teachers, and students in her school learn how to integrate ChatGPT in impactful ways. Hear her view on the potential of AI in education and where it fits into the history of digital transformation in the classroom. Which profession do you want to hear from next?

Codex will roll out to Pro, Enterprise and Teams users over the next few days, and more broadly in the coming weeks. It's a new way of building software, and it should allow far more people to build than ever before More info at
Post: Had a great time speaking with OpenAI about how AI is transforming the way John Deere serves our customers by simplifying complexity and helping our customers work more profitably and sustainably. Whether its ensuring customers are getting the maximum value out of precision equipment like See & Spray or the digital tools that optimize farm operations, this kind of technology ensures customers are more efficient and using data to make critical decisions. Its not just farmers who benefitdealers face immense pressure too. In the past, diagnosing a machine issue could take hours, sifting through thousands of pages of manuals and repair records. Today, AI-powered tools can instantly analyze all that data, offering precise diagnostics, parts lists, and repair instructions. This means faster resolutions and less downtime for everyone involved. Were committed to driving success and efficiency in agriculture - down to the very last plant.

Post: Artificial intelligence is transforming how we live, work, and conduct scientific research. Today, we partnered with the U.S. Department of Energys National Laboratories to hold a first-of-its-kind 1,000 Scientists AI Jam Session that brought together more than 1,000 scientists to explore how AI can accelerate scientific discovery. During Fridays event, researchers across nine national labs,,,,,,,, andtested advanced AI reasoning models, including OpenAI o3-mini, on thousands of scientific challenges in fields ranging from energy and physics to biology and medicine. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright joined OpenAI President and Co-Founderat Tennessees Oak Ridge National Laboratory to meet with participating researchers and emphasize AIs critical role in the future of science, national security, and Americas global competitiveness. Secretary Wright told the scientists that AI has the potential to increase life expectancy, lead to the development of new drugs, and fuel innovation by allowing scientists to solve problems that were seen as intractable. Greg shared that he hoped AI would make scientists 10 times or 100 times more effective at their work in the coming years. Todays event builds on a long-standing tradition of the U.S. government working with companies to drive innovation, create jobs, fuel economic growth, and strengthen national security. Were grateful to all the scientists who participated in todays jam session, and look forward to continuing our work with the national labs to strengthen U.S. leadership in both AI and scientific discovery.
